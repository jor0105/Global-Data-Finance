# AI Coding Agent Anti-Patterns and Diff Sanity Guide

> Summary: Comprehensive reference of common mistakes, shortcuts, and erosion patterns introduced by AI coding agents during refactoring or feature implementation, and how to intercept them locally.

## 1. Catalog of AI Coding Agent Traps

### 1.1 Leftover Debug and Inspection Artifacts

AI agents frequently insert statements to inspect runtime states and forget to remove them:

- **Python**: `breakpoint()`, `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`, raw `print()` statements in library/core code.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `debugger;`, `console.log(`, `console.dir(`.
- **Rust**: `dbg!(...)`, `println!(...)` in production crates.
- **Go**: `fmt.Println` in internal services without logger.

### 1.2 Unfulfilled Stubs and Placeholders

When generating broad scaffolds or completing functions hurriedly, agents may leave placeholder implementations:

- `raise NotImplementedError("TODO")`
- `throw new Error("TODO: implement")`
- `pass  # TODO` as sole body of new public functions.
- `return null; // FIXME`

### 1.3 Erosion of Type Safety and Lint Disables

To pass validation gates without fixing underlying contract issues, agents often silence compilers:

- `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck` in TypeScript.
- `# type: ignore` or `# noqa` in Python. The diff gate always rejects `# noqa`, including rule-specific forms and lines with a reason or `allow-bypass`.
- `as any` casting without explanation.
- `// eslint-disable-next-line` without a stated reason.

### 1.4 Test Integrity Violations

When a test fails following an implementation change, agents sometimes weaken or skip the test instead of fixing the implementation:

- Inserting `.only` (e.g. `it.only(`, `describe.only(`) to run only one test and bypass failures elsewhere.
- Adding `@pytest.mark.skip`, `@pytest.mark.xfail`, `it.skip()`, `xit()`.
- Removing assertions (`assert`, `expect(...)`) or replacing specific assertions with tautologies (`expect(true).toBe(true)`).

### 1.5 Unsynchronized Dependency Changes

- Adding a dependency to `package.json` or `pyproject.toml` without running the package manager lock command.
- Committing phantom packages not reflected in lockfiles.

## 2. Detection Strategy in Diff

Quality gates must analyze lines starting with `+` in `git diff --cached`:

1. **New violations must trigger `FAIL`**: A newly introduced `console.log` on a staged line is a hard block.
2. **Intentional exceptions require the narrowest safe scope**:
   - Fix the code first. If a lint rule legitimately applies only to a CLI or script, use the appropriate file/scope or an explicit per-file lint configuration; never add `# noqa`.
   - If a type ignore is necessary due to a third-party untyped library, annotate with `# type: ignore[specific-code]  # reason: untyped upstream`.
   - `# noqa`, `# noqa: <rule>`, and any `# noqa` accompanied by a reason or `allow-bypass` are always violations.
