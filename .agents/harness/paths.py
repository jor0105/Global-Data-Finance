"""Root resolution for harness tooling.

A harness script reads its own content — skills, agent definitions,
workflows, schema — from *this* repository, and reads or writes project
artifacts in whatever repository the operator is standing in. Those are two
different roots. Deriving both from ``__file__`` only works while the
harness lives inside the consuming repository, which is no longer the case.

Scripts bootstrap this module by putting the harness root on ``sys.path``:

    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3]))
    from harness.paths import HARNESS_ROOT, repo_root

    The three fan-out scripts read their canonical sources from here. When
    the operated repository holds a published projection lock at
    ``.agents/harness.lock.json``, every content type resolves to the
    projection: ``repo_root()/.agents/<name>``, whether or not that subtree
    exists on disk — a missing subtree means the consumer selected nothing
    of that type. Without a lock the installed harness root is the source.

    The decision is the lock file alone; nothing here reads or interprets
    the lock's content, the manifest or the catalog. ``harness/selection``
    and ``harness/projection`` never call this function: they always read
    component sources from the installed distribution.
